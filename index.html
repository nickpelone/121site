            What are holograms?<br>
            Well, according to Wikipedia, Holograms are...:
                </p>
            
            <p class="fromWikipedia">Holography is a technique which enables three-dimensional images to be made.
                It involves the use of a laser, interference, diffraction, light intensity recording and suitable illumination of the recording.
                The image changes as the position and orientation of the viewing system changes in exactly the same way as if the object were 
                still present, thus making the image appear three-dimensional.
                The holographic recording itself is not an image;
                it consists of an apparently random structure of either varying intensity, density or profile.</p>
            <p class="genericContentText">So in other words, Holograms are three-dimensional illusions that can be made in a multitude of ways. When you look at one, it's view is unique depending on the angle of view. Looking at a hologram from a different perspective allows you to see different parts of the three-dimensional object or scene being created.</p>

        <p class="headerText"><a name="inventor">Who invented them:</a></p>
            <p class="genericContentText">
            So who invented these things anyway?<br>
                Well, it's more accurate to describe who discovered their use.
            </p>
            <p class="fromWikipedia">The Hungarian-British physicist Dennis Gabor (in Hungarian: Gábor Dénes) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971 "for his invention and development of the holographic method". His work, done in the late 1940s, built on pioneering work in the field of X-ray microscopy by other scientists including Mieczysław Wolfke in 1920 and WL Bragg in 1939. The discovery was an unexpected result of research into improving electron microscopes at the British Thomson-Houston (BTH) Company in Rugby, England, and the company filed a patent in December 1947 (patent GB685286). The technique as originally invented is still used in electron microscopy, where it is known as electron holography, but optical holography did not really advance until the development of the laser in 1960. The word holography comes from the Greek words ὅλος (hólos; "whole") and γραφή (grafē; "writing" or "drawing").
</p>
<p class="fromWikipedia">The development of the laser enabled the first practical optical holograms that recorded 3D objects to be made in 1962 by Yuri Denisyuk in the Soviet Union and by Emmett Leith and Juris Upatnieks at the University of Michigan, USA. Early holograms used silver halide photographic emulsions as the recording medium. They were not very efficient as the produced grating absorbed much of the incident light. Various methods of converting the variation in transmission to a variation in refractive index (known as "bleaching") were developed which enabled much more efficient holograms to be produced.
